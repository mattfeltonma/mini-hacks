# Azure Authorization Mini-Hack

## Overview
This mini-hack focuses on authorization within Azure. With Entra ID acting as a single identity and authentication boundary, authorization is critical to the security of Azure. Authorization within Azure is far more complex than it seems and has many options for securing access with each having its own benefits and considerations.

The goal of this mini-hack is to help you better understand how authorization works in Azure by experimenting with the different controls made available to you. The exercises in this hack include:

[Exercise 1 - Azure RBAC notActions](exercises/exercise1.md)
[Exercise 2 - Resource Locks](exercises/exercise2.md)
[Exercise 3 - Azure Policy Deny Actions](exercises/exercise3.md)
[Exercise 4 - Azure RBAC Deny Assignments](exercises/exercise4.md)
[Exercise 5 - Azure ABAC](exercises/exercise5.md)
[Exercise 6 - Azure RBAC Delegation](exercises/exercise6.md)

I have also put [together a series of blog posts](https://journeyofthegeek.com/2024/02/11/azure-authorization-the-basics/) on these topics if you'd like to do some reading before doing the doing.
